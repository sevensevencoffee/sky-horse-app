            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Effective Date: 5/27/2025</p>

            <p>Thank you for using Tinto ("we", "us", or "our"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We strive to collect as little personal information as possible.</p>

            <h3>a. Photos & Media</h3>
            <p>Our App accesses your photos only when you grant permission and only to apply filters or edits locally on your device. We do not upload or store your photos on our servers.</p>

            <h3>b. Analytics</h3>
            <p>We may collect limited, anonymized usage data (such as feature usage or crash reports) to help improve the app. This may be collected through third-party services such as Firebase or Apple's analytics tools.</p>

            <h3>c. Optional Features</h3>
            <p>If you choose to use cloud backup (e.g., iCloud), your data is stored securely by Apple under their privacy policies. We do not access these files.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use information only to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide and improve app features.</li>
                <li>Understand app performance and user preferences.</li>
                <li>Fix bugs or crashes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We do not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sell your data.</li>
                <li>Use your photos for any purpose without your permission.</li>
                <li>Share your personal information with third parties for marketing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Your Privacy Choices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You can choose not to share usage data by adjusting your device settings.</li>
                <li>You can revoke photo access at any time in iOS settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take security seriously. All photo processing is done on-device, and any anonymized analytics are stored securely using industry-standard practices.</p>

            <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we learn we have collected such data, we will delete it promptly.</p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll notify you through the app or on our website if there are material changes.</p>
